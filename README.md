### Day 10:
**Today's Progress:**  
Today, I deepened my understanding of functions in Python by creating functions with multiple outputs, nested functions, and a comprehensive calculator program that utilizes a dictionary to store operations.

**What I Learned:**  
- **Function Definition and Return Values**: Practiced defining functions that return formatted names and other values based on input.
- **Function Nesting**: Explored how to call one function inside another, such as using `echo_text` within `format_text`.
- **Leap Year Calculation**: Implemented a function to determine if a year is a leap year, reinforcing logical conditionals.
- **Creating a Calculator**: Developed a calculator that supports basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using a dictionary to map operation symbols to their corresponding functions. This allowed for cleaner code and better organization.

**Challenges:**  
The main challenge was managing the flow of the calculator, especially allowing for continued calculations with updated values while keeping the user interface clear.

**Thoughts:**  
Today was productive as I consolidated my understanding of functions and how they can interact. The calculator project was particularly satisfying, combining various elements I've learned so far. I'm excited to explore further enhancements, such as adding more operations or error handling for invalid inputs.
